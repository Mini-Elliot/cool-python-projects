    "what is the purpose of the yield keyword": "The yield keyword turns a function into a generator. Instead of returning a value and terminating, it saves the function's state, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off.",
    "what are context managers in python": "Context managers handle the setup and teardown of resources using the with statement. They ensure that resources like files and network connections are properly released even if errors occur.",
    "what are python coroutines": "Coroutines are special functions that can pause and resume execution using the yield or await keywords. They are used for cooperative multitasking and asynchronous programming.",
    "what is asyncio in python": "asyncio is a Python library used for writing asynchronous programs. It enables concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks without blocking the main thread.",
    "what is the difference between threading and multiprocessing in python": "Threading allows concurrent execution but is limited by the GIL, while multiprocessing creates separate processes that can run in true parallel, making it better for CPU-bound tasks.",
    "what are python type hints": "Type hints allow developers to specify variable, function argument, and return value types. They help improve code readability and reduce errors by enabling static type checking.",
    "what is the difference between staticmethod and classmethod": "staticmethod is a method that does not depend on the class or instance, while classmethod receives the class as its first argument and can modify class-level attributes.",
    "what is a metaprogramming in python": "Metaprogramming refers to writing programs that manipulate code dynamically. Python supports this using decorators, metaclasses, reflection, and dynamic code generation.",
